# Excercise
## 1 - HTML template

Refer: https://colorlib.com/wp/template/aroma/

## 2 - Repl.it project with HTML pages

Refer: https://repl.it/@DuyPhucPhuc/EStoreHTML

## 3 - Repl.it project for Rails app demo

Refer: https://repl.it/@DuyPhucPhuc/EStoreRailsDemo

**NOTE**: It's quite clumsy to develop Rails app on repl.it.  
So to save time, I have downloaded the project and finish it locally then re-import to repl.it :p  
And it's seem ImageMagic cannot be installed on repl.it, because of that my app have some limitations.

Should we have other solution than repl.it?
